This set of input files were used for the simulations presented in the manuscript. Specifically,  Projects_tasks.xlsx presents the 10 projects that must be scheduled. These projects comprise of 26 tasks, with a total of 240 FTEs (person-weeks), and the organization has 8 teams available that can work on these tasks. Further, each row represents a project with its score and set of tasks (along with the teams suitable to perform each task) that must be performed for that project. For example, to schedule project 1, two tasks must be performed, that require 7 and 10 person-weeks by teams 1, and 2, respectively.

Further, the files Personnel_cassign.xlsx, Personnel_rassign.xlsx, and Personnel_fassign.xlsx present the organization structure for scenarios Cassign, Rassign, and Fassign, respectively. In scenario Cassign the organization consists of 25 persons assigned to the aforementioned 8 teams, and the current team configuration of the organization is presented in Personnel_cassign.xlsx (i.e., the number of persons assigned to each team, as well as all the properties concerning each team). Further, in scenario Rassign (Personnel_rassign.xlsx), 17 persons are assigned to the aforementioned teams, as 1 person from each team can potentially be reassigned. Finally, in scenario Fassign (Personnel_fassign.xlsx), 0 personnel are allocated to any team, all personnel can be reassigned by the proposed approach.
